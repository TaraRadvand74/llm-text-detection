# Zero-Shot Statistical Tests for LLM-Generated Text Detection and Attribution using Finite Sample Concentration Inequalities

This repository contains the official code to replicate experiments from our paper:

## 📁 Contents

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Whiteboxdetection.ipynb` | Runs statistical detection tests using access to the LLM (white-box setting). |
| `Whiteboxattribution.ipynb` | LLM Attribution: identifies the generating model among two sets of candidates. |
| `Blackbox_adverserial.ipynb` | Tests black-box detection and robustness of our detection against adversarial attacks. |

All experiments were run on RunPod (B200) and use Hugging Face models and datasets where applicable.

## 🧪 How to Run

Each notebook is fully self-contained and includes:

- Installation and environment setup (in the first cells)
- Data loading and preparation
- Full experiment code with results

💻 **No setup beyond running the notebook cells is required** — all dependencies are installed inline.

## 📥 Data

Most datasets used in the experiments are downloaded programmatically from 🤗 Hugging Face.

However:

> **If you'd like to run the WritingPrompts experiments**, you'll need to download the WritingPrompts dataset manually from:  
> 🔗 [https://github.com/facebookresearch/WritingPrompts](https://github.com/facebookresearch/WritingPrompts)

Place the downloaded data in the following path:
data/writingPrompts/

We thank the authors of DetectGPT for open-sourcing their codebase.
